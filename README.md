# ogg

Pure Go implementation of the ogg container format library. See [www.xiph.org/ogg] for more info about ogg.

### ToDo:
- Testing 100%. Right now, only one test fails.
- Check which funcs/types/vars needs to be visible outside the package
- Commenting the funcs / types (godoc)
- Goroutines?
- Take a look at the license stuff
- Send a mail to Xiph.org ?
- Vorbis also. But this will be cgo.
